Copy pass storage location, adding 0x20 to each character.

Password length to lookup is returned.

Passlookuptable[] = "0123456789-+#?C$FHJKLMNPQ!TVWXY=";

0 out a memory location size of password length.

Turn 5 bit to 8 bit.

Read the lenghth, and do a sanity check.  Length > 1K invalid, as is length = 0.

Read each byte.  If not 0, copy directly to storage location.
If 0, then read the next byte, and and store xx+1 0s to copy to location, then resume normal
copying.


Verify copied/expanded data contains 0xA5 at location 1. If not, data is invalid. Checksum located at location 0.

Unsure of next operation (decode the data?)

copy the checksum, then zero location 0.

Checksum the data.  If checksum doesn't match calculated, the data is invalid.

Format of Data after it is decoded from human readable password.

Offset	Size	Description
0000	2	Length (N) of decompressed data. RLE compressed data block size may vary.
0002	(N)	RLE compressed data block, (only 0s are RLE encoded.)

Data structure of track datablock, after decompressed from decoded password block.

Offset	Size	Description
0000	1	Checksum
0001	1	Constant 0xA5 byte
0002	1	Car used to set Record
0003	1	Theme, 11 in total, from 00-0A.
0004	8	Name of Driver setting record
000C	14	Name of Course
0018	1	1/100ths seconds.  Least significant 7 bits store 0-99, and most significant bit 
		determines if a second has elapsed or not.
0019	1	Seconds/Minutes.  least significant 5 bits stores seconds * 2, and most significant
		3 bits stores the minutes.
001C	32	Track Data layout, 256 locations, 16x16 grid.
003C	256	Physical Track layout.(size depends on how many bits are set in the 256 bit bitmap.)


Track piece 00 is no track.
Track pieces 01-7F are 1x1 track pieces.
Track pieces 80-BB are 2x2 track pieces.
Track pieces BC-FF are 3x3 track pieces.
